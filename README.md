# Lucky-Duck
### Test your luck vs a Computer with an original Duck Tarot Deck!

#### Game Idea
Players: one player vs computer.

At the start of the game, each player are given 3 Lucky Duck Tarot cards at random and will be faced down.
Each card represents their past, present, and future respectively.

The winner is the player with the highest value adjudicated by subtracting the Present card with the Past card, and adding the Future card.
Ex: Total Luck = Present - Past + Future

Players will take turns and decide their fate.

Decide if they want to change their card with a random card from the deck.
Keep the card they currently have.
Once a turn has passed the player can no longer trade their card.
Player’s card will be revealed.

There will be 6 turns alternating player’s: Past, Present, Future.

At the end of the game, players will also be given a Lucky Duck Fortune reading based on their Total Luck.

The deck will consists of 44 cards. Each card will be a Duck meme with it's type, number, and a description.

12 major arcana representing a Duck’s life.

6 Fire Ducks (Popular memes) + 1 Fire Duck King, 1 Fire Duck Queen

6 Water Ducks (Emotional memes)) + 1 Water Duck King, 1 Water Duck Queen

6 Air Ducks (Witty memes)) + 1 Air Duck King, 1 Air Duck Queen

6 Earth Ducks (Cute memes)) + 1 Earth Duck King, 1 Earth Duck Queen

Based on the number of cards and possible values, it can range from -43 to 87, which equates to 130 total luck. 
Each fortune is tied to an interval of set values. 
For example -40 to -45, 40 to 45, or 10 to 15 have an assigned fortune.
There is a total of 26 fortunes that can be given based on the total luck a player has.

### Tech Stack
* DOM Manipulation. 
* Arrays to retreive Duck Tarot Card, description, and number value.
* Game logic to shuffle remaining cards, and retrieve one. 
* Winning logic to give fortune with total luck value. 
* Possibly use Canvas, but I think all of this can be achieved with just DOM.
