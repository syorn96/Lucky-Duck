#### Game Idea
### Link to game: https://syorn96.github.io/Lucky-Duck/
Players: Two.

Game modes: Player 1 vs Player 2, or Player 1 vs. Computer.

Play against another person or computer to see who is the Luckier Duck.
The player with the highest Total Luck is the winner and will receive a fortune!

At the start of the game, two players are given 3 random Lucky Duck Tarot cards faced down.
Each card represents their past, present, and future respectively.
The Luckier Duck is the player with the highest Total Luck calculated by subtracting the Present's card value with the Past's card value, and adding the Future's card value.

Ex: Total Luck = Present - Past + Future

Player 1 and Player 2 will take turns and decide their fate.
Both Players will each have 3 turns; one for their past card, present card, and finally their future card.
During each turn, the current player will decide if they want to switch their card with a random card from the deck, or keep the card they currently have.
Once a turn has passed the player can no longer trade their card and the turn's card will be revealed.

The deck will consists of 44 cards. Each card will be a Duck meme with it's type, number, illustration and a description. 

There will be 12 Major Arcana cards representing a Duckâ€™s life.

There will be 8 (Popular memes) Fire Duck cards: 6 Fire Ducks  + 1 Fire Duck King + 1 Fire Duck Queen.

There will be 8 (Moody memes) Water Duck cards: 6 Water Ducks + 1 Water Duck King + 1 Water Duck Queen.

There will be 8 (Witty memes) Air Duck cards: 6 Air Ducks+ 1 Air Duck King + 1 Air Duck Queen.
